# This file defines the contenttypes on the website. See the documentation for
# details: http://docs.bolt.cm/content#defining-contenttypes
#
# Each 'content-type' roughly corresponds to a single table in the database.
# If you update this file, be sure to log into the Bolt backend and click the
# button to update the database.

# Pages are used for the more 'static' pages on the side -- things like
# 'about us', 'contact', or 'disclaimer'.
#
# This content-type also will let you customize the exact template you use
# so that you can specify how exactly the page should look.

# Using YAML repeated nodes
#
# YAML allows the defining of "repeated nodes". These allow you to define a 'node'
# with a 'key: &name' and referenced later with '<<: *name'
#
# Bolt allows you to define this with the special entry of '__nodes:' that itself 
# won't create a Contenttype, but will allow you to use it in actual contenttypes
# to prevent repeating yourself.
#
# To achieve this, first create a key '__nodes:' 
#__nodes:
#    field_defaults: &field_defaults

#            filter: '*.twig'
